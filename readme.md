### Goals

1. Getting started with web design
2. What is a web framework
3. Basic concepts
4. Web design workflow
5. Further resources

### Getting Started

- Browser / Developer tools
- Text editor (e.g., [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/))
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)
- Bootstrap files vs CDN
- [Emmet -- HTML tool](https://emmet.io/)

### What is a framework?

- Anatomy of a webpage
- What a framework does
- Why Bootstrap

### Basic Concepts

- Classes
- [Bootstrap Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/)
- [Bootstrap Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/alerts/)
- [Bootstrap Utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/utilities/borders/)
- [Bootstrap Breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/overview/#responsive-breakpoints)
- [Bootstrap Accessibility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/accessibility/)
- Serving Fonts (e.g., [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/))

### Workflow

Clearly the process is iterative :repeat: rather than linear. One step often clarifies the previous and may lead you either forward or backward. This is all fine and good and normal! 

#### 1. What's this page trying to do or convey? For whom?

Take a minute to consider the big picture. What specifically are you trying to accomplish with this particular view or page? Who is your target audience or user? At the very least, consider the minimum your peers would need to accomplish this goal--whether the goal is "Understand the Project Aims" or "Create an Account" or "Pour the Rest of Our Waking Hours into Playing this Addictive Game".

#### 2. Wireframe

Draw! Even if for a minute, make sure you have a rough outline of what the elements of the page are, how this page interacts with other pages you have in mind.

#### 3. Pseudocode

Write! Do you know what combination of HTML elements and Bootstrap classes will (roughly) get you to the design elements and layout you have in mind?

#### 4. Implement big chunks

Before sweating the small stuff, get the big blocks in order. Before diving into why the font you want isn't showing up, why not make sure the navigation, main container, any sidebars, and footer are (more or less) where you want them. This is a good place to begin testing whether the page appears as expected on different screen sizes.

#### 5. Accessibility

Does the page meet (ideally exceed) basic accessibility needs? [Web Accessibility In Mind (WebAIM)](https://webaim.org) is a great place to start. Particularly [their free WAVE tool](http://wave.webaim.org/) that tests pages for common errors.  

#### 6. Niceties

Okay, now :mag: you can start futzing with the minutiae like fonts, spacing, colors, and images. Ideally this should involve testing in multiple browsers and getting fresh eyes on your page. If possible get feedback on interacting with the page and feedback on trying to accomplish particular tasks.
